# Motion Detection System

This repository contains a motion detection system implemented in Python using computer vision techniques. The system can detect motion in a video feed or a sequence of images, making it suitable for various applications such as security, surveillance, and automation.

## Features

- Motion detection using background subtraction and contour analysis.
- Adjustable sensitivity and threshold parameters.
- Supports video input from webcams, IP cameras, and recorded video files.
- Real-time and batch processing modes.
- Easy-to-use Python script for motion detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Imutils
- Tkinter

📷 Motion Detection System using Python
A real-time motion detection system using OpenCV in Python. This project captures video from a webcam or video file, processes it frame-by-frame, and detects any motion in the scene. When motion is detected, it can log the event, save frames, or trigger alerts.

🔧 Features
📹 Real-time video feed (webcam or video file)

🕵️‍♂️ Motion detection using frame differencing

📝 Timestamped motion logging

💾 Save motion-detected frames or short clips

🔔 (Optional) Alert mechanism (email, sound, etc.)

⚙️ Simple and customizable Python code

📓 Logs:
Motion events can be saved to MotionDetector_Logs.txt with timestamps if logging is enabled.
